### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the color scheme, I had a few ideas I wanted to play around with. I wanted to use the special olympics grey and red, as used in their logo. I also decided I wanted to incorporate the colors of the Olympic Rings. This is a site for young athletes. I thought this mix of colours would be it bright and child friendly. 

## **Current Features Common to all pages**
###  **Header**
![Heading Element](assets/images/heading-nav-bar.jpg))

For the header, I decided to incorporate the Special Olypics Logo with a Nav bar. I wanted to keep it clean and free from clutter. I designed a header element to float and remain seen at the top of the page. I personally always like to be able to see the top of page. I thought it worked well so I kept it. I originally did not have this set to stick, it look just off when I was scolling. It is centered and adjusts to all screen sizes, remaining the same. It also links to an additional 2 pages. 

#### *Logo:*
* The logo brings a sporty offical vibe to the page.

### **Hero Image**
* I have included one hero image on the main page. It is designed using the olympics ring, with an image in each ring.

### **About Page**:
The hero image depicts the athletes in the olypic rings. I thought it might be a cool feature and way to show of the athletes and introduce a colour theme. The about page also provides a small summary about what we try to achieve at SOYA. It then breaks down some of the key skills areas and finishes off with a calander of up comming classes, dates, times and more details.

### **memories page**:
I wanted to add a gallery style page, where atheletes developments can be shared. 

### **Sign up page:**
A Simple page where new athletes can be signed up. 

## **Anchor Tags**
* All anchor tags in areas where it would not seem obvious to a user, the underline has been left in to let the user know, this is clickable. 

## **Footer**
* The footer includes direct links to all the clubs socials, trainings and memberships. 

* These icons were imported from font awesome using Javascript at the bottom of the page. I followed the same method from the love running project.

## **Future-Enhancements**
I think in the future I would like to revist this site and turn into something great. I think with some more time spent in planning, a better understanding of CSS and responsive design, thrown in with some Java Script, I think this site could really serve a purpose.
